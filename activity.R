#COURSE PROJECT 1. REP. RESEARCH (WEEK 2)

## 1) Code for reading in the data set and/or processing the data

## Packages loading required for plotting data, mostly using ggplot2

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(lattice)
```

## Data importing from a csv file and generation of a new data set without NAs

```{r}
data <- read.csv("A:/Project Y06_Pre-Clinical Experiments/R Course/homework/Week 2 Course Project 1/repdata_data_activity/activity.csv", header = TRUE, sep = ",")
data <- transform(data, date = as.Date(date))
adata <- data[!is.na(data[1]),]
```

## Dates transforming into days format using a loop for easier plotting. Coding steps per day function

```{r}
get_steps_per_day <- function(d) {
  steps_per_day <- tapply(d$steps, d$date, sum)
  steps_per_day <- data.frame(cbind(day = names(steps_per_day), steps = steps_per_day))

steps_per_day <- transform(steps_per_day, day = as.Date(day))
steps_per_day <- transform(steps_per_day, steps = as.numeric(as.character(steps)))}
```

## 2) Histogram of the total number of steps taken each day. NAs can be ignored, so data was used instead of adata.

```{r echo = FALSE}
ggplot(data, aes(x = date, y = steps)) + geom_bar(stat = 'identity') + ylab("total steps") + ggtitle("Number steps / day")
# This histogram is named as Figure 1 in the files.
```

## 3) Mean and median number of steps taken each day. Coding steps per interval function

```{r}
get_steps_per_interval <- function(d) {
  steps_per_interval <- tapply(d$steps, d$interval, mean)
  steps_per_interval <- 
    data.frame(cbind(interval = names(steps_per_interval), steps = steps_per_interval))
  
  rownames(steps_per_interval) <- NULL
  
  steps_per_interval <- transform(steps_per_interval, interval = as.numeric(as.character(interval)))
  steps_per_interval <- transform(steps_per_interval, steps = as.numeric(as.character(steps)))
}

total_steps_per_day_adata <- get_steps_per_day(adata)

mean(total_steps_per_day_adata$steps)
# The mean total steps per day was 10766.19

median(total_steps_per_day_adata$steps)
# The median steps per day was 10765
```
  
## 4) Time series plot of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and average number of steps taken, averaged across all days (y-axys).

```{r}
average_steps_per_interval_adata <- get_steps_per_interval(adata)
# Subset of 288 obs and 2 variables
```

```{r echo = FALSE}
plot(average_steps_per_interval_adata$interval, average_steps_per_interval_adata$steps, type = "l", xlab = "interval", ylab = "average steps", main = "Average steps / interval")
# Time course plot is based on intervals and not in days (Figure 2).
# Maximum steps (200k) found at interval range 800-900
```

## 5) The 5-minute interval that, on average, contains the maximum number of steps

```{r}
is_max <- average_steps_per_interval_adata$steps == max(average_steps_per_interval_adata$steps)

max_per_interval <- average_steps_per_interval_adata[is_max,]
interval_for_max <- max_per_interval$interval
# 835 interval has 206.1698 steps, which correlates with the maximum peak in previous plot
```

## 6) Code for imputing missing data. Calculate and report the total number of NAs in the data set.
## Devise a strategy for filling in all of NAs. You can use the mean/median for that day or the
## mean for that 5-minute interval. Create a new data set equal to the original but with the NAs filled in

```{r}
total_Nas <- sum(is.na(data$steps))
# 2304 NAs in data. This is correct because data - NAs = adata (17568 - 2304 = 15264obs)

filled_data <- data
na_index <- which(is.na(filled_data$steps))

for(i in na_index) {
  interval <- filled_data$interval[i]
  filled_data$steps[i] <- average_steps_per_interval_adata[average_steps_per_interval_adata$interval ==interval,]$steps
}

# The new object filled_data, or fdata for short, has the same number of elements than the original data set
# with NAs, data. NAs have been replaced with average steps per interval for each NAs. Filled data have the 
# same number of observations as data has: 17568 obs and 3 variables.
```

## 7) Histogram of the total number of steps taken each day after NAs are imputed. Calculate the 
## mean and median total number of steps taken per day. What is the impact of imputing missing data on the
## estimates of the total daily number of steps?

```{r echo = FALSE}
tot_steps_day_fdata <- get_steps_per_day(filled_data)
ggplot(tot_steps_day_fdata, aes(x = day, y = steps)) + geom_bar(stat = "identity") + ylab("total steps") + ggtitle("Number steps / day with filled NAs")
# Figure 3
```

```{r}
mean(tot_steps_day_fdata$steps)
# The mean of steps with filled NAs is 10766.19 vs 10766.19, which is the exact number
```

```{r}
median(tot_steps_day_fdata$steps)
# The median of steps with filled NAs is 10766.19 vs 10765, which is almost the exact number

# Filling missing values with the average steps per interval does not impact the total daily number of steps,
# despite the plots between data and fdata look different
```

## 8) Panel plot comparing the average number of steps taken per 5-minute interval across weekdays and weekends.Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends? Use weekdays() function and the data set with the filled-in missing values for this part. Create a new factor variable in the data set with two levels "weekday" and "weekend" indicating whether a given date is a weekday or weekend day. Make a panel plot containing a time series plot of the  5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all weekday days or weekend days (y-axis).

```{r}
weekdays_list <- c("lunes", "martes", "miÃ©rcoles", "jueves", "viernes")
# Days were written in Spanish due to R version using weekdays() function

filled_data$day_of_week <- weekdays(filled_data$date)
filled_data$type_of_day <- factor(filled_data$day_of_week %in% weekdays_list,
                                  levels = c(TRUE, FALSE),
                                  labels = c("weekday", "weekend"))

# First of all, new variables need to be included in our fdata: day of week and week type and type of day

weekday_data <- filled_data[filled_data$type_of_day == "weekday",]
weekend_data <- filled_data[filled_data$type_of_day == "weekend",]

weekday_steps <- get_steps_per_interval(weekday_data)
weekend_steps <- get_steps_per_interval(weekend_data)

weekday_steps$type_of_day <- factor(TRUE, levels = c(FALSE, TRUE), labels = c("weekend", "weekday"))
weekend_steps$type_of_day <- factor(FALSE, levels = c(FALSE, TRUE), labels = c("weekend", "weekday"))

weekday_weekend_steps <- rbind(weekday_steps, weekend_steps)
xyplot(steps ~ interval | type_of_day, data = weekday_weekend_steps, layout = c(1,2), type = "l",
       xlab = "Interval", ylab = "Number of steps", main = "Number of steps / interval weekday vs weekend")

# After assigning these variables, we subset the number of steps for weekdays and weekends and proceed to
# performed the desired time plot of number of steps for each interval in weekdays vs weekend (Figure 4)
```

# 9) All of the R code needed to reproduce the results (numbers, plots, etc.) in the report

# 10) Export the assignment in a single R Markdown document that can be processed by knitr and be
# transformed into a HTML file
